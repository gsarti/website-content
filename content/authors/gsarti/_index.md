Welcome to my website! üëã I am a PhD student in the [InCLoW team](https://inclow-lm.github.io/) within the [Natural Language Processing group](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl/) (GroNLP üêÆ) at the University of Groningen. I'm also a member of the [InDeep consortium](https://projects.illc.uva.nl/indeep/), working on user-centric interpretability for generative language models. My supervisors are [Arianna Bisazza](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~bisazza/), [Malvina Nissim](https://malvinanissim.github.io/) and [Grzegorz Chrupa≈Ça](https://grzegorz.chrupala.me).

Previously, I was a applied scientist intern at [Amazon Translate NYC](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/conversational-ai-natural-language-processing), a research scientist at [Aindo](https://www.aindo.com), and a [Data Science MSc](https://dssc.units.it/) student at the University of Trieste, where I helped found the [AI Student Society](https://www.ai2s.it).

My research aims to translate theoretical advances in language models interpretability into actionable insights for improving trustworthiness and human-AI collaboration. To this end, I lead the development of [open-source interpretability software](https://github.com/inseq-team/inseq) projects to enable reproducible analyses of model behaviors. I am also excited about the potential of [human behavioral signals](https://gsarti.com/msc-thesis/introduction.html) such as keylogging, gaze and brain recordings to improve the usability and personalization of AI solutions.

Your [(anonymous) constructive feedback](https://www.admonymous.co/gsarti) is always welcome! üôÇ
