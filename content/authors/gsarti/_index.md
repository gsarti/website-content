Hey there! I have recently graduated from the Data Science MSc program at the University of Trieste and SISSA. For my thesis project, I worked with the [ItaliaNLP Lab](http://www.italianlp.it/) and the [L2R Lab](https://lrlac.sissa.it/) under the joint supervision of Felice Dell'Orletta and Davide Crepaldi on NLP and psycholinguistics perspectives for linguistic complexity assessment.

My research interests focus on interpreting deep models and understanding their learning dynamics, in particular when dealing with natural language. I am also interested in positive social applications of machine learning and ethical AI.
