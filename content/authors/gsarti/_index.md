I'm a Master student in Data Science at [University of Trieste](https://www.units.it/) and [SISSA](https://www.sissa.it/), currently working at [ItaliaNLP Lab](http://www.italianlp.it/) with Felice Dell'Orletta for my thesis project on NLP. My research interests focus on interpreting deep models and understanding their learning dynamics, in particular when dealing with natural language. I am also interested in positive social applications of machine learning and AI ethics.
