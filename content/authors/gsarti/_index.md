Welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹ I am a PhD student at the [Computational Linguistics Group](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl/) of the University of Groningen. I am part of the NWO-funded project [InDeep: Interpreting Deep Learning Models for Text and Sound](https://interpretingdl.github.io), focusing on interpretability for neural machine translation. I am supervised by [Arianna Bisazza](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~bisazza/), [Malvina Nissim](https://malvinanissim.github.io/) and [Grzegorz ChrupaÅ‚a](https://grzegorz.chrupala.me).

<br>

Previously, I was a research scientist at [Aindo](https://www.aindo.com), a student in the [Data Science MSc](https://dssc.units.it/) at University of Trieste & SISSA and a founding member of the [AI Student Society](https://www.ai2s.it). My [master's thesis](http://gsarti.com/thesis/introduction.html) with the [ItaliaNLP Lab](http://www.italianlp.it/) in Pisa was about the study of linguistic complexity using gaze recordings and neural language models.

<br>

My research focuses on interpretability for NLP models, in particular to the benefit of end-users and by leveraging human behavioral signals. I am also passionate about social applications of machine learning, ethical AI, and open source collaboration.
