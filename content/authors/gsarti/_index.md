Welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹ I am a PhD student at the [Computational Linguistics Group](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl/) of the University of Groningen and member of the [InDeep consortium](https://projects.illc.uva.nl/indeep/), working on user-centric interpretability for neural machine translation. I am also the main developer of the [Inseq](https://github.com/inseq-team/inseq) library. My supervisors are [Arianna Bisazza](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~bisazza/), [Malvina Nissim](https://malvinanissim.github.io/) and [Grzegorz ChrupaÅ‚a](https://grzegorz.chrupala.me).

<br>

Previously, I was a research intern at [Amazon Translate NYC](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/conversational-ai-natural-language-processing), a research scientist at [Aindo](https://www.aindo.com), a [Data Science MSc](https://dssc.units.it/) student at the University of Trieste and a co-founder of the [AI Student Society](https://www.ai2s.it).

<br>

My research focuses on interpretability for generative language models, with a particular interest to end-users' benefits and the usage of [human behavioral signals](https://gsarti.com/msc-thesis/introduction.html). I am also into causality topics and open source collaboration.
