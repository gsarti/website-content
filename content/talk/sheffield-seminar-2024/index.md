summary: "This talk discusses the challenges of interpreting generative language models and presents Inseq, a toolkit for interpreting sequence generation models. The usage of Inseq is illustrated with examples introducing state-of-the-art approaches for interpreting language models such as contrastive attribution. Finally, the PECoRe framework is presented as a mean to evaluate the plausibility of context usage in language models."
