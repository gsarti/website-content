summary: "Is it possible to induce sparseness in neural networks while preserving its performances? An overview of latest advances in making neural approaches more parsimonious"
abstract: "Lottery ticket hypothesis is one of the latest and most significant advances in the field of theoretical deep learning, suggesting that sparse yet effective representations can be found inside large overparametrized neural networks. We present a brief introduction to the context of neural network pruning and proceed to present three significant papers discussing the impact of lottery ticket hypothesis in deep learning research."
