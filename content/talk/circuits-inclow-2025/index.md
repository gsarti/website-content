summary: "The presentation discusses interpreting latent features in large language models (LLMs). After an introduction on mechanistic interpretability fundamentals, including feature superposition and sparse autoencoders, I discuss recent work by the Anthropic interpretability team (Ameisen et al. 2025, Lindsey et al. 2025) for extracting circuits of interpretable features from trained LLMs. Real-world investigations of Claude mechanisms, such as multi-step reasoning and multilinguality, are also analyzed."
