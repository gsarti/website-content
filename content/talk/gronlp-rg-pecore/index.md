summary: "This talk presents the PECoRe framework for quantifying the plausibility of context reliance in neural machine translation. The framework is applied to a case study on the impact of context on the translation of gendered pronouns and
other contextual phenomena in English-to-French translation. Finally, the online demo allowing users to try PECoRe with any
generative language model is presented."
