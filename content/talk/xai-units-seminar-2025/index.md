summary: "In this presentation, I will provide an overview of the interpretability research landscape and describe various promising methods for exploring and controlling the inner mechanisms of generative language models. I will start discussing post-hoc attribution technique and their usage to identify prediction-relevant inputs, showcasing their usage within our PECoRe framework for context usage attribution, and its adaptation to produce internals-based citations in retrieval-augmented generation settings (MIRAGE). The final part will present core insight from recent mechanistic interpretability literature, focusing on the construction of replacement models to build concept attribution graphs and their practical usage for monitoring LLM behaviors."
