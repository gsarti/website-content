### 2022

**May 23-30, 2022**: Hosted [Michael Carl](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael-Carl) at the University of Groningen, with talks about translation processes and interpretability for machine translation.

***

### 2021

**Sep 1, 2021**: Starting a PhD in interpretable neural machine translation at the worderful [GroNLP](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl/) group under the supervision of [Arianna Bisazza](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~bisazza/), [Malvina Nissim](https://malvinanissim.github.io/) and [Grzegorz Chrupa≈Ça](https://grzegorz.chrupala.me), as a part of the NWO-funded consortium [InDeep: Interpreting Deep Learning Models for Text and Sound](https://interpretingdl.github.io).

**Jul 31, 2021**: Last day of work at [Aindo](https://www.aindo.com). In the last months I worked on structured prediction from clinical reports, few-shot cross-lingual transfer for neural QA models, GNN for molecular properties prediction, neural recommender systems and sketch-to-image generation with GANs.

**Jul 23, 2021**: Participated in the [HuggingFace JAX/Flax Community Week](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/open-to-the-community-community-week-using-jax-flax-for-nlp-cv/7104) building the first [CLIP image-text model for Italian](https://huggingface.co/clip-italian/clip-italian) (demo [here]([https://](https://huggingface.co/spaces/clip-italian/clip-italian-demo))) and the first [T5 seq2seq model pre-trained on Italian](https://huggingface.co/gsarti/t5-base-it). I also cleaned the largest available Italian corpus to date, the Italian split of [mc4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mc4) (full size after cleaning ~103M docs, 41B words, 215Gb), making it available [on the HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gsarti/clean_mc4_it).

**Jan 1, 2021**: Started working full-time as ML research scientist for [Aindo](https://www.aindo.com/).

***

### 2020

**Dec 11, 2020**: Graduated cum laude from the Data Science MSc at the University of Trieste and SISSA with my thesis [Interpreting Neural Langauge Models for Linguistic Complexity Assessment](https://gsarti.com/thesis/introduction.html), under the supervision of Felice dell'Orletta and Davide Crepaldi.

**Oct 19, 2020**: Developed and open-sourced [LambdaBert](https://github.com/gsarti/lambda-bert), a BERT implementation based on [lambda layers](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xTJEN-ggl1b) instead of self-attention. Viral on [Made with ML](https://twitter.com/madewithml/status/1318533780630499332).

**Sep 28, 2020**: Attended the "Deep Learning Theories in Neuroscience" session at the Oxford Virtual Autumn School in Neuroscience.

**May 8, 2020**: Organizing the [AI, Stats & COVID-19](https://www.units.it/news/ai-stats-covid-19) event with AI2S, with more than 100 participants from around the world.

**Mar to Jun, 2020**: Main developer for the [Covid-19 Semantic Browser](https://github.com/gsarti/covid-papers-browser), a joint project by [AILC](https://www.ai-lc.it/en/) and [Area Science Park](https://www.areasciencepark.it/), covered in the news [by](https://www.ai-lc.it/en/covid-19-browser-2/) [many](https://www.units.it/news/covid-19-tre-studenti-di-units-elaborano-un-semantic-browser) [sources](http://futuro24.blog.rainews.it/2020/06/19/futuro24-innovazione-dalla-ricerca-sul-coronavirus/), including the [NLP Newsletter by Sebastian Ruder](http://newsletter.ruder.io/issues/covid-19-edition-236509) and the Anthony Goldbloom talk at the [Stanford HAI conference on COVID-19 and AI](https://hai.stanford.edu/video-archive-covid-19-and-ai-virtual-conference)

**Mar 22, 2020**: Officially founded [AI2S](https://www.ai2s.it/), the first AI student society in Friuli-Venezia Giulia.

**Feb 13, 2020**: Presented the *"Hey Siri, what's computational linguistics"* interactive talk at [SISSA Student Day 2020](https://www.ai-lc.it/en/ailc-sissa-student-day-2020-2/).

**Feb 10-14, 2020**: Attended the course "Eye-tracking Methods for Cognitive Science" by Elizabeth Schotter at SISSA.
